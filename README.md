This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple burger builder application developed using React. A user can build his/her own burger and proceed to checkout and view all the orders. Though itâ€™s a very simple app but it covers all the important concept of React like, state management with Redux, stateful components and stateless components, higher order components, loading components asynchronously and how to plan for what would be a stateful component and what would be a stateless component. Firebase has been used as the backend for user authentication
